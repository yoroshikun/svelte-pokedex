# Svelte Pokedex Test

A simple curioisity project to test the Svelte framework.
It utilises the PokeAPI to get data from the Pokemon API.
As it is a simple project, it is not optimised for performance, nor following best practices and is not feature complete.
Feel free to use it as a learning project. Or raise issues to teach me more about best practices!

## Developing

Run the dev server with

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of this app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

> This project is not designed for production use
